# Sleeper Cli

A lazy script to keep your computer on while you are away or bored.

## Commands

### Leave

Using leave will make your mouse bounce around the screen for the time you passed in.

```shell
sleeper leave --minutes 10
sleeper l -m 10
```

### Open

Using open with a url as the second param will open that window after that amount of time. Made this so I won't stress out about opening zoom links on time.

```shell
sleeper open --minutes 10 http://localhost:3000
sleeper o -m 10 http://localhost:3000
```
